# Ben Stoner â€“ Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio!  
Here you'll find Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) I developed for production planning and SAP workflows at SRAM.

## ðŸ§¾ Documents

- [WeekPlanTotals SOP](main/SOP - Add Postings to Teams (Monday).pdf)
- [MTS Inventory Update SOP](SOPs/MTS_Inventory_Update_SOP.pdf)
- [CO02 Work Order Change SOP](SOPs/CO02_Change_Work_Orders_SOP.pdf)

Each document demonstrates clear instructions, process alignment, and visual guidance for end users.
